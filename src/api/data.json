      "description": "Dan Brown's 'The Lost Symbol' was the most anticipated novel of 2009, and was the literary event of the year. Alex Carmine examines all the themes in depth, and provides a chapter-by-chapter analysis of 'The Lost Symbol'. From Alex's assessment of the novel, it is very much apparent that Dan Brown has not only been adhering to his own formula, but that he has also been following Joseph Campbell's concept of the hero's journey. We know that Dan Brown likes to play with the names of his characters, so Alex explores these in great detail. In this way, Alex reveals the name of the real American family upon whom the Solomons are based. Alex also shows that, following its development within 'The Da Vinci Code', Dan Brown's still very much in tune with his 'sacred feminine' side, with his stunning representation of womb envy. Dan Brown's fascinating depiction of masculinity within this novel is studied too. In addition to this, Alex explores the literary devices that Dan Brown employs, and the magical sleights of hand that he uses to make the reader look the wrong way. Indeed, one of the main arguments in this book is that Dan Brown has hidden much of the true meaning of 'The Lost Symbol' behind various veils of allegory, much as the Masons do with regards to their secrets, and like the Symbologist Robert Langdon, Alex reveals these meanings to you. However, Dan Brown is an author who also likes to reward his readers, so Alex examines the clues about the novel that he disseminated prior to publication via Facebook and Twitter. Furthermore, Alex considers the various Masonic practices depicted within the novel, and bring to the fore the conspiracy theories that surround this mysterious fraternity. Alex Carmine's very close reading of the novel literally leaves no stone uncovered, and will transform your own interpretation of the text.",

As the famous author of the thriller series that included The Da Vinci Code, Brown has produced masterpieces that stand on the shelves of novel lovers everywhere. As well as authoring several popular books, Brown is well known for promoting an alternative approach to Christianity. Religion is a theme that is featured throughout the books he writes, sometimes in a way that has drawn in criticism from theologians. Despite this, Brown has declared in several interviews that his life is one big spiritual journey that he feels will never end. EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK Brown graduated from Phillips Exeter in 1982, at which point he went on to continue his education at Amherst College. Brown's time there saw him became a successful college squash player, as well as a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. It was not until Brown chose to spend a year of his education in Seville, Spain, that he began focusing on the works of Leonardo da Vinci, an interest that led to the main themes in his books. Brown later returned to Amherst College to complete his education, eventually graduating in 1986 with a degree in English and Spanish. After obtaining his degree, Brown had a brief stint as an unsuccessful singer and song writer. He attempted to establish himself in Los Angeles, producing and releasing several children's albums. Although he had considerable talent as a song writer, he could not stand up against the other talents in LA, but this was to lead to his future literary success. It was there that he met his wife Blythe, who would later be the person who spurred him towards his achievements as an author... Buy a copy to keep reading!",

As he does in all his novels, Brown[‘s] extensive research on art, architecture, and history informs every page.\" —Entertainment Weekly Robert Langdon, Harvard professor of symbology, arrives at the ultramodern Guggenheim Museum Bilbao to attend the unveiling of a discovery that “will change the face of science forever.” The evening’s host is Edmond Kirsch, a forty-year-old billionaire and futurist, and one of Langdon’s first students. But the meticulously orchestrated evening suddenly erupts into chaos, and Kirsch’s precious discovery teeters on the brink of being lost forever. Facing an imminent threat, Langdon is forced to flee. With him is Ambra Vidal, the elegant museum director who worked with Kirsch. They travel to Barcelona on a perilous quest to locate a cryptic password that will unlock Kirsch’s secret. Navigating the dark corridors of hidden history and extreme re­ligion, Langdon and Vidal must evade an enemy whose all-knowing power seems to emanate from Spain’s Royal Palace. They uncover clues that ultimately bring them face-to-face with Kirsch’s shocking discovery…and the breathtaking truth that has long eluded us.",
